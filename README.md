# Homework assignment üìú
1. ### Description 
   Welcome, this is a github homework assignment it implements a guess the number game in the range from 1 to 100
2. ### What was done
   - [x] A repository has been created in "homework" in github 
   - [x] An algorithm for finding a number from 1 to 100 has been written for a maximum of 7 attempts
   - [x] Gitignore and requirements created

 Below you can see the main function [This is a link to the source file](https://github.com/Nikolairopin/Homework/blob/main/Module/game.py) 
 ```python
def random_predict(number: int = 1) -> int:

    # –¥–∏–∞–ø–∞–∑–æ–Ω —Å–ª—É—á–∞–π–Ω–æ–≥–æ —á–∏—Å–ª–∞
    low = 0
    high = 100
    # —Å—á–µ—Ç—á–∏–∫ –ø–æ–ø—ã—Ç–æ–∫
    count = 0

    while low <= high:
        # –ø–µ—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è —Ö—Ä–∞–Ω—è—â—â–µ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ–ª–∞–≥–∞–µ–º–æ–µ —á–∏—Å–ª–æ 
        guess = (low + high) // 2
        count += 1
        # –º–µ–Ω—è–µ–º –¥–∏–∞–ø–∞–∑–æ–Ω –∑–∞–≥–∞–¥–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ —á–∏—Å–ª–∞
        if guess == number:
            return count
        elif guess < number:
            low = guess + 1
        else:
            high = guess - 1
```
